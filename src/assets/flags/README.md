# Flags for OpenRouter Translator

This directory should contain flag images for the supported languages in the quick translate section. The files should be named using the language code with the `.png` extension.

## Required Flag Files

- `en.png` - English (United States)
- `th.png` - Thai
- `ja.png` - Japanese
- `zh.png` - Chinese
- `ko.png` - Korean
- `es.png` - Spanish
- `fr.png` - French
- `de.png` - German

## How to Get Flag Images

You can use emoji flags in the application, or you can download proper flag images from various sources:

1. Free flag icon sets from websites like [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/packs/flags-4) or [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons/set/flags)
2. Country flag APIs like [CountryFlags.io](https://www.countryflags.io/)
3. Public domain flag repositories

Place the downloaded PNG files in this directory (`src/assets/flags/`).

## Note on Flag Usage

When using country flags to represent languages, be aware that some languages are spoken in multiple countries. The flags used in this application are meant to provide a visual reference for quick language selection and may not represent all regions where a language is spoken.
